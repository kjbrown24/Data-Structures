# Drink Ordering System

This project is a simple command line program where customers can order drinks, review their order, and confirm it. The system also trakcs open and completed orders and shows a report at the end of the day.

1. Menu
#Data Stucture: Python List
#The menu uses a list to store drink objects. This makes it easy to loop through and display each drink.
#Getting a drink by its number is fast 0(1) time.

2. Customer Order
#Data Structure: Linked List
#A linked list lets us add or remove drinks easily as the customer builds their order.
#Adding a drink is fast 0(1). Removing ot printing the order takes 0(n).

3. Order Confirmation
#Data Stucture: Uses methods in the Customer_Order class
#After an order is created, it's printed out using a loop. No extra data structure is needed.
#Printing the order takes 0(n), where where n is the number of drinks.

4. Open Orders Queue
#Data Strucure: Deque
#Orders are handled in the order they were places (FIFO). A deque supports fast adding/ removing from both ends.
#Adding and removing order is 0(1) time.

5. Completed Orders
#Data Strucutre: Stack
#Completed order are stored in a stack so we can later pop them out and check them for the report.
#pushing and popping are both 0(1) time.
